## Winsock Reconnection Idea


</div>

### Description

I want to promote the idea of giving your client-side apps a reconnection feature. This is convenient if you need your clients to automatically reconnect to the server. Good for server-client cafe management and networked desktop locking. I do believe that there are other ideas and ways to do this and if you DO have a better idea, I'll appreciate it if you could share it with me since I need this feature for a school project. I have included a simple server-client chat to demonstrate this feature. To test, compile both server and clients into exe format then just run any number of clients either with the server running or not. Then just close the server and then run it again to see your clients reconnecting. That's it. Hope this helps and if you feel like it please do vote. Cheerio!
